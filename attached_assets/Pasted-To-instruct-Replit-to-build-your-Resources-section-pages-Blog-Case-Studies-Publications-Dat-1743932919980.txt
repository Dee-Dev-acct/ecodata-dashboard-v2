#### 🔧 Pages to Implement:
Create the following **resource content pages** under `/resources/` or as individual routes with dynamic routing:

1. **Blog Page**
   - Display blog articles with thumbnails, author name, publish date, tags.
   - Use Markdown or CMS-compatible format for content.
   - Add animation on scroll (e.g., Framer Motion or Animate.css).
   - Allow blog filtering by category or tag.
   - **Optional**: Pull live news/articles from [Dev.to API](https://developers.forem.com/api) or Medium (if preferred).

2. **Case Studies Page**
   - Show case studies in grid layout with:
     - Title, sector, location, impact type.
     - Cover image and quick stats.
     - “Read more” link to a detailed subpage.
   - Add animated stats or reveal-on-hover details using motion.
   - **Optional API Source**: Pull anonymized Open Data case examples from [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/).

3. **Publications Page**
   - Present reports/papers in card or table view.
   - Include download links, publication year, author/org, and topic tag.
   - Animate document icons with hover.
   - Provide a filter by topic/year.
   - **Optional API Source**: Pull environmental datasets or papers from [Europe PMC API](https://europepmc.org/RestfulWebService).

4. **Data Insights Page**
   - Embed real-time charts (Bar, Pie, Line) using Recharts or Chart.js.
   - Pull live data via:
     - [UK Air Quality API](https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/interactive-map)
     - [OpenAQ API](https://docs.openaq.org/)
     - [CO2.Earth](https://co2.earth/api)
   - Add tooltip animations and data refresh button.
   - Include map visualization using Leaflet for regional data.

5. **FAQs Page**
   - Accordion-style Q&A display.
   - Animate open/close with friendly micro-interactions.
   - Option to search/filter questions.
   - Add contact CTA if a user doesn’t find their answer.

#### 💡 Shared Elements:
