**1. Build the Initial Prototype**  
We’ve already developed most of the front end with static HTML/CSS/JS and a functional contact form. For the initial prototype, we’d like Replit to help with:
- Structuring backend routes using Express (e.g., form submission, admin panel access)
- Connecting to a Microsoft SQL Server database for storing form submissions
- Implementing spam protection and live validation
- Ensuring responsiveness across devices

**2. Additional Features (Yes, we’d like these!)**  

Please include the following now or structure it in a way we can expand to them easily later:

- ✅ **Basic CMS functionality**: Yes — being able to update services, about, and testimonials without redeploying would be very helpful. Even a simple markdown-based CMS or flat-file editor would work to start.
  
- ✅ **Analytics dashboard**: Yes — we’d love to track basic metrics like page views, referral sources, and form interactions. Open to using something lightweight or integrating with Google Analytics.

- ✅ **Project portfolio with case studies**: Definitely — we’d like to have a separate page or dynamic section to showcase past work and impact stories, including images and descriptions.

- ✅ **Newsletter subscription**: Yes — this would be useful for future updates. It can be a simple email capture form for now, possibly integrating with Mailchimp or storing emails in the database.

**3. Timeline and Visual Preview**

- **Visual Preview (~2 min)**: Replit’s preview looks great. We’re ready to see how it interprets the front-end layout and enhances it dynamically.
  
- **First App Version (~10 min)**:  
We’re aiming for a simple but functional backend with content editing, form handling, and a working admin panel. We’re open to iterating based on your suggestions!

Let me know if you’d like a direct link to the current HTML/CSS/JS codebase or additional branding assets (logos, icons, etc.). We’re excited to build this with your help!
