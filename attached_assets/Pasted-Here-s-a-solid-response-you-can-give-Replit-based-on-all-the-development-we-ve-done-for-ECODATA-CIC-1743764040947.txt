Thank you! I’d be happy to provide more details.

**1. Purpose of the Website**  
The website is **informational** and acts as a **digital portfolio** for our company, **ECODATA CIC**, a community interest company that provides IT consultancy, data analytics, and environmental and social research services. The goal is to:  
- Showcase our services  
- Explain our data-driven impact on clients and communities  
- Build trust with potential partners and funders  
- Make it easy for users to contact us

**2. Key Features / Functionality**  
So far, we’ve developed the front end with the following sections:  
- Hero/banner with intro text  
- About section  
- Services offered  
- Technology framework used  
- Social and environmental impact metrics  
- Contact form with validation and email integration (using Nodemailer)
- Embedded Leaflet map  
- Footer with quick links and contact info

Additional features we’d like help enhancing:
- Admin panel to view submitted messages  
- Testimonials section  
- Blog setup (for updates, case studies, thought pieces)  
- Character counters, loading spinners, and animations for form UX  
- Spam protection using a honeypot field  
- Live validation and form submit control  
- Possibly basic CMS functionality to update content without redeploying

**3. Design Preferences / Branding**  
- Clean and modern look, using a dark/light theme switcher  
- Accent color palette inspired by nature (greens, blues, and neutral tones)  
- Rounded corners, soft drop shadows, and minimal layout  
- We’ve used custom CSS for styling and want to keep it consistent  
- Accessibility and mobile responsiveness are important

**4. Technology Stack / Constraints**  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Map:** Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap tiles  
- **Backend (planned):** Node.js with Express  
- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server  
- **Deployment:** Will eventually host on a secure platform (e.g., Azure, Railway, or Replit)  
- We aim to keep dependencies minimal and code easy to maintain
